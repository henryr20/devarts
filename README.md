## 📖 Project Description

The **Home Page** serves as the central hub of DevArts. It features a Hero section with a call-to-action and a **Featured Tip** section that displays technical art advice stored in a JSON array.

The **Gallery Page** is a dedicated space that renders high-quality 3D art pieces from a structured JSON array, providing a responsive grid view with modal details.

The **Tips Page** provides a collection of technical workflows with video support, allowing users to dive deep into game art production.

The **Contact Page** includes a functional contact form and an interactive location map using Leaflet.

## 🧩 Third-Party Components

This project leverages several industry-standard libraries to enhance functionality:
- **React Router Dom**: Handles client-side navigation between Home, Gallery, Tips, and Contact pages. [Documentation](https://reactrouter.com/)
- **Leaflet & React Leaflet**: Powers the interactive map on the Contact page. [Documentation](https://react-leaflet.js.org/)
- **FontAwesome**: Provides scalable vector icons for social media and UI elements. [Documentation](https://fontawesome.com/)
